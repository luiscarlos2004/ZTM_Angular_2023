Angular is for large sites applications
Cli is a required to configure the application
AppFiles -> AngularCLI -> Bundle
ng version = This command tests angular cli intalled
Angular comes with a server
Monitor files for changes
Requeried for Http requests
Editorsconfig = 
Angular.json = to configurate the project 
Architect is the most crutial option this contain information for buiding the project
Build = production enviroment. the enviroment. to share to production. build the project for production
Serve = development the application. Server using for the project. build the projec for dedvelopment
extract = translation for the project.
text = testing the project.
tsconfig.App = to config our application
tsconfig.spec = to config our testing
tsconfig = 
extends helps with the configurations
load angular before app = 
main.ts
Main Entry file  = Load Angular fremewook than load the app-code(inside SRC folder called main.ts)(Needs to load the angular framewoork, loads the app code).
Architect contains everything for buiding the project

Aot compilation = 
Compilation = transform one language to another(Process of transformating code into a machine  code)
Angular provides two compilations = in time compilation, 


Just-In-Tie = Larger file size, Loads slower since compiler needs to run in browser, catch errors in browser
Ahead-Of-Time = Small file size Loads faster since the app is compiled on delivery to the browser, catch error on the server
Just-In-Time(JIT)
server -> TypeScript code -> Browser dowload the code (Template, service, modules) inlcuded the compiler -> Browser runs app

Ahead-Of-Time(AOT)

-----//-----
Loading platform
helps angular undertand the enviroment
There are two ways to compile plaform. Compilation extractegies helps angular to undertand the enviroment
Develop app for the browser
App.module.ts = contains the module to start our app
 
-----//-----
Change detention : process the update the html whenever date updatded
reactivity
change detention runs = When the app is initializated, During changes in our data, Manually triggering change detention.
Change detention runs twice when an app is inicialized

Development option = optimization is the most important 

Product -> Single Product -> Product List -> GetImage()
App modules helps other developer identify modules 
Module is written as a class

Angular is primary use on the browser
can run angular on mobile devices

using component is like using any another task

external templates and style
Model = Data,View = HTML,CSS ,Controller = Typescript class

src = 
src / assets = for static files
polyfills = supoting future no avaibale on the browser
app.component.spect.ts = this files contain the information for test the components
Apps are built by components

-----//-----
interpolation =
An expression is a single line of code that evaluates to a value
Not expression = functions, conditions, variable declaration
expression = {{name}} this is to handle expressions
